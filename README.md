.# TxTracer

TxTracer is a web application designed for tracing and analyzing transactions on the TON (The Open Network) blockchain.
It provides developers and users with tools to visualize and understand transaction flows, inspect contract states, and
debug smart contracts. The application features a code editor for viewing TVM assembly and a user-friendly interface
for navigating complex transactions.

Based on [TxTracer-core](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/txtracer-core).

## How to use

Go to https://txtracer.ton.org/, enter the transaction hash or transaction link from explorer,
click the "Trace" button, and start diving into the contract!

TxTracer supports links from the following explorers:

- `https://ton.cx`
- `https://tonviewer.com`
- `https://tonscan.org`
- `https://explorer.toncoin.org`
- `https://dton.io`

If you want to share a link to a specific transaction, you can add the `tx` parameter:
